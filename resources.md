# Resources

This is a log of resources used to create a tactile font

## Different Tactile Fonts
* [Overview of Differsent Kinds of Tactile Fonts](https://www.nyise.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=438103&type=d&pREC_ID=948713)

* [Barbier Night](https://brailleworks.com/braille-resources/history-of-braille/)

This font is based on French and has too many rows but you can clearly see how it is a predecessor to Braille.

* [Moon Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_type)
* * [Detailed explanation of MoonType](http://www.deafblind.com/moon.html)
* * [Moon Project what it looks like in the world](https://www.behance.net/gallery/51421037/Moon-Type-for-the-Blind)

This is just not very efficient and would be hard for a blind person to use to actually write with. It is really neat though and kind of looks like Egyptian Hieroglyphics.

* [Elia Frames](http://www.theeliaidea.com/)

This font focuses too much on the sighted. The fact that it is based on the Roman print is a setback. For the fingers, it seems like it may be more complex than Braille. Given it's many lines. it requires a large size to be discernable to see. I think it has low information density. Above all, being literate includes both reading and writing. I am nout sure how a blind person would write this. I am not sure how this font benifits those with low vision who see well enough to read large print (fonts greater than 16pts) or those who cannot read print at all.
